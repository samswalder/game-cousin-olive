- Organized CSS (consider using BEM or similar methodology)

### Content Sections

- Projects showcase (with descriptions, links, screenshots)
- Spotify links section
- Contact/Social links

### Common Tasks
```bash
# Serve locally (if using a dev server)
# python -m http.server 8000
# or npx serve

# For framework-based setup (if chosen):
# npm install
# npm run dev
# npm run build
```

## Important Notes
- Keep the design clean and professional
- Ensure all external links (Spotify, project links) open in new tabs
- Optimize images for web performance
- Make sure the site is fully responsive across devices

## Preferences
- Preferred package manager: (npm/yarn/pnpm - specify if using one)
- Keep dependencies minimal for a portfolio site
- Focus on performance and fast load times

## Spotify Integration
- Links to Spotify profile, playlists, or specific tracks
- Consider using Spotify embed widgets if desired
- Ensure proper link formatting (open.spotify.com URLs)

## Areas Requiring Caution
- Don't commit any API keys or credentials if using Spotify API
- Optimize image sizes before adding to assets
- Test cross-browser compatibility
